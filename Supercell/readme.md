Firmware
=======

Supercell supports the Superparasites firmware, which combines elements of the original Clouds DSP code by [Mutable Instruments](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack), the [Parasites](https://mqtthiqs.github.io/parasites/clouds.html) alternate firmware by Matthias Puech, and the [Beat Repeat](https://github.com/jkammerl/eurorack) alternate firmware by Julius Kammerl. All source code is available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/patrickdowling/superparasites) maintained by Patrick Dowling. Thanks to all involved for their work on this hybrid code base.
